Brief Description: This is a small, curated dataset containing anonymized health data of 2,392 patients, a minority of which have been diagnosed with Asthma Disease. 

**Model**

The model is a simple Random Forest binary classification model. Since it is a decision-tree based model and the original dataset is well-curated with no missing values, no preprocessing of data is necessary. 

Model inputs: select features with relatively higher correlation with the target.

Model outputs: an array containing the value 0 for a negative diagnosis (no asthma) and the value 1 for a positive diagnosis (asthma)
